# Log-Parser-Pro
A lightweight Bash script for parsing and filtering .csv log files. It extracts key fields (IP, Date, Method, URL, Protocol, Status), supports single and dual search filters, and includes optional output compression. Built with robust input validation and user-friendly CLI prompts, it's ideal for quick log analysis and Linux scripting practice.

ðŸ“š Learning Reflection

This project was a deep dive into Bash scripting, especially coming from an object-oriented programming background (VB, C++, Java, Python). It challenged me to think differentlyâ€”leveraging Unix tools like grep, sed, and cut instead of traditional libraries. Itâ€™s a great stepping stone toward Linux system administration and scripting proficiency.
